![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71541429/128601631-85bc3b18-0cd5-4f91-b5bc-c656f359e9bb.jpeg)

## Features of the Code :
* Encodes Binary Data into Hamming Code, using a suitable number of Parity Bits in appropriate positions.
* Variable-length Data Input Sequences can be Encoded successfully.
* The Individual Parity Bits generated by the Encoder are also displayed.
* The code also displays the length of the Encoded Data (Data Bits + Parity Bits)
* Data Extraction from Hamming Encoded Sequences is also performed by this code.
* Variable-length Transmitted Sequences can be Decoded.
* The Received Sequence is checked for Errors.
* If no Errors have occurred in transmission, the Decoded Binary Sequence is displayed.
* Single Bit Errors in Received Data are Detected (if present), the Error Bit is located and displayed.
* Received Data Sequences with Single Bit Errors are Corrected and the correct Binary Data is displayed.
* Supports both Odd and Even Parity Encoding / Decoding.
